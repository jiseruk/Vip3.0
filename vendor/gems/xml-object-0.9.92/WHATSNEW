* 0.9.92 (2009-10-29):
  - Tested under 1.9.1, 1.8.7, 1.8.6, and JRuby 1.4.0RC3
  - [API CHANGE!] No longer requires rubygems (ooops)
  - [API CHANGE!] No longer attempts to require 'activesupport', you must
    do it yourself to use inflections and such.
  - [API CHANGE!] Removed 'jordi-xml-object' since Github gem serving is
    going away, you must require 'xml-object' now.
  - Added VERSION constant
  - Changing gemspec to take advantage Gemcutter workflow
  - Better global namespace hygiene
  - Back to using Test::Unit (ze tools, ze tools, le sigh)

* 0.9.91 (2009-06-23):
  - Fixes a bug where consecutive collection proxies confused XMLObject
    mid-parsing (Thanks to Josef Spillner)
  - Dropped the Hpricot support. Not worth it, API changes too often, and
    libxml-ruby now rocks more than ever.

* 0.9.9 (2008-12-18):
  - Bugfix for the new faster-than-nokogiri Hpricot version (broke the API)

* 0.9.8 (2008-10-23):
  - Much improved test suite. More granular, better coverage, much faster
  - The collection proxy behaviour is now a lot faster when called in a loop
  - Collection Proxies are a lot more transparent
  - Reduced memory footprint of instantiated XMLObject trees
  - Calling elements, attributes, question methods or pluralized collections
    (anything, really) that's not there raises NameError instead of just
    returning nil
  - Removed #rb (wasn't really all that useful)
  - The [:sym => 'foo'] notation now only supports :attr and :elem
  - The question method notation is a bit more strict
  - JREXML adapter removed. It barely sped up REXML under JRuby

* 0.9.7 (2008-10-20):
  - LibXML adapter added
  - JREXML "adapter" added, as well as JREXML support during tests and
    benchmark tasks, but only when running under JRuby
  - Backwards incompatible change: Elements with no text and multiple CDATA
    values no longer report their value as their first CDATA element. They
    report all of their CDATA nodes joined together, a-la LibXML

* 0.9.6 (2008-10-19):
  - Ruby 1.9 compatibility
  - XMLObject no longer requires ActiveSupport. Note that proper array
    pluralization still depends on ActiveSupport's Inflector, so if it's not
    there, we just pluralize things by tacking 's' at the end.
  - XMLObject no longer tries to load Hpricot by default (too cumbersome
    to test). Use "require 'xml-object/adapters/hpricot'" to enable the
    Hpricot adapter.
  - Backwards incompatible change. For the following XML:

      <foo>
        <bar>
        <bez>
      </foo>

      <foos>Yipes!</foos>

    before:

      xml.foos => # The <foo> "array"

    now:

      xml.foos => # The <foos> element

    It proved too expensive to support that edge case, and for no good
    reason.

* 0.9.5 (2008-10-15):
  - Project renamed to XMLObject, to match project name at Rubyforge.
    The other names were taken. :(

* 0.9.0 (2008-10-15):
  - Added support for plug-able adapters
  - Backported REXML code as an adapter, added Hpricot adapter
  - Performance: XMLStruct now decorates objects lazily
  - Performance: XMLStruct uses the Hpricot adapter if possible, otherwise
    REXML as a fallback
  - API Change: XMLStruct.new is mostly delegated to the adapter, and both
    included adapters behave the same: a String is considered to be
    XML data, anything else is probed for #read and then #to_s

* 0.2.1 (2008-10-13):
  - Fixed a bug where attributes with dashes would crash the party

* 0.2.0 (2008-10-13):
  - Broke backwards compatibility
  - XMLStruct.new now returns decorated String or Array objects, so that
    access to elements, attributes, and "collection" values is consistent
  - While Strings are no longer auto-typecast to float or int, they now
    have, whenever possible, a question-mark form, which attemps to
    returns booleans for strings like "Yes" and "false"
  - XMLStruct.new can now take a filename or a file object
  - Added more tests

* 0.1.3 (2008-10-10):
  - Switched tests to use test/spec
  - Added XMLStruct#to_obj to return the corresponding Ruby object value
  - Added XMLStruct#to_raw_xml to return the REXML object
  - Added documentation on auto-typecasting behaviour caveat

* 0.1.2 (2008-10-10):
  - Documentation

* 0.1.1 (2008-10-10):
  - First "release" ;)
